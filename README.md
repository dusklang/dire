# Dire: Dusk Intermediate REpresentation
This is (or will be) an intermediate representation library inspired by [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/), primarily for use in the Dusk programming language.

Goals:
- Fast
- Extensible
- Flexible: should be able to represent everything from super high-level code, all the way down to assembly
